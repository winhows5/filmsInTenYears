                    In the past ten years, numerous outstanding domestic and foreign films have sprung up in the Chinese film market. In order to observe the characteristics of the movie market, the chart was drawn to show the box office per ten days of every film in every
                    year between 2008 to 2017(data source:<a href="https://www.cbooo.cn">cbooo.cn</a>, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com">IMDb.com</a>). As a whole, the box office market shows obvious periodicity between years
                    and growth trend. And more details will be discussed below.<br>(It should be noted that the data for 2017 ended August 20th)</p>

                    <p class="lead">The <i>Wolf Warriors Ⅱ</i> fiery patriotism ignited a collective release, at the same time people also cheered the great breakthrough of domestic films. We would like to take this opportunity to objectively judge the development of
                        box office market of China from the data.<br> In the past ten years, domestic box office and non-domestic box office were shown on the bottom chart --box office by year.It's clear that the proportion of domestic films did not increase
                        significantly on the ten year scale in spite of the increase of the amount,<br> (data source:<a href="https://www.cbooo.cn">cbooo.cn</a>, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com">IMDb.com</a>)</p>

                        shown by the light orange line.<br>According to these data, it's easy to get the conclusion that the competitiveness of domestic films in China's box office market have not improved significantly.</p>

                <h3>What is the impact of policy on films?</h3>
                <p class="lead">
                    In fact, the proportion of 50% of China films is really high, considering the contrast with films from all over the world. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this is the result of external forces. In order to verify this conjecture, the box office
                    data for 12 months a year was calculated and displayed on the following chart, there are 2 lines for the whole box and foreign films box only from 2008 to 2017.</p>

                <p class="lead"> <br></p>
                <p class="lead">Those two points could be easily summed up:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p class="li">The whole box office has a wave of peaks in February, August and October almost every year</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="li">The foreign film box office hit bottom in February, August and October almost every year</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead">The reason for the first point could be that they are in the new year, summer vacation and national day respectively. What is interesting is that the whole box goes peaks while the foreign film box hit the bottom, which is likely that
                    some related national policies are protecting domestic films' box office, e.g. <i>China film protection month</i>.
