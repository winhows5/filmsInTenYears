                    In the past ten years, numerous outstanding domestic and foreign films have sprung up in the Chinese film market. In order to observe the characteristics of the movie market, the chart was drawn to show the box office per ten days of every film in every
                    year between 2008 to 2017(data source:cbooo.cn, IMDb.com). As a whole, the box office market shows obvious periodicity and growth trend. More details will be discussed below.<br>(It should be noted that the data
                    for 2017 ended August 20th)</p>

                    <p class="lead">The <i>Wolf Warriors Ⅱ</i> fiery patriotism ignited a collective release, at the same time people also cheered the domestic film breakthrough. We would like to take this opportunity to objectively judge the development of China's film
                        box office market from the data.<br> In the past ten years, domestic box office and non-domestic box office were shown on the left chart --box office by year.In spite of the increase in the amount, the proportion of domestic films
                        did not increase significantly on the ten year scale.<br> (data source:cbooo.cn, IMDb.com)</p>

                        as shown by the light orange line.<br>According to these data, wFrom these data, we conclude that the competitiveness of domestic films in China's box office market have not improved significantly.</p>

                    From the previous chart, we can see that the box office is partially cyclical in its annual performance.In order to verify this conjecture, we calculated the box office data for 12 months a year and displayed on the left chart, there are 10 lines for
                    all films from 2008 to 2017(the darker the line, the higher the year) and 10 lines for foreign films from 2008 to 2017(the lighter the line, the higher the year).<br>It is easy to see that in February, August and
                    October each year, the box office has a wave of peaks.The reason for the speculation is that they are in the new year, summer vacation and national day respectively.</p>
